## Key Topics for the day:

- Advanced class queries/methods
- Advanced instance methods
- Private methods
- Mass Assignment (& metaprogramming)

## Key Skills
- Class methods vs Instance methods
- How to use the `self` keyword and identify what it will refer to
- Class variables vs Instance variables

<Note>

The key topics for the day are:
- Advanced class queries/methods
- Advanced instance methods
- Private methods
- Mass Assignment (& metaprogramming)
And the key skills you'll be working on are:
- how to identify and distinguish between Class methods and Instance methods
- how to use the `self` keyword and identify what it will refer to
- how to distinguish between class and instance variables

The methods we'll be working on today are related to persisting and retrieving Dogs– both of which are are important tasks that we'll continue to do as we introduce new concepts like databases and ActiveRecord later on in the week. The lectures coming up over the next few days will be introducing variations on the same themes. You'll be seeing how the new concepts apply to the application we've been working on throughout the phase.

## Keyword Arguments & Mass Assignment

This is what our initialize method looks like currently:

```rb
class Dog
  attr_accessor :name, :age, :breed, :image_url
  def initialize(name, age, breed, image_url)
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @breed = breed
    @image_url = image_url
  end
end
```

And creating a new instance looks like this:

```rb
dog = Dog.new("Lennon Snow", "1 year", "Pomeranian", "https://res.cloudinary.com/dnocv6uwb/image/upload/v1609370267/dakota-and-lennon-square-compressed_hoenfo.jpg")
```

<Note>

The first concept we're going to talk about about today is keyword arguments and mass assignment.

This is what our initialize method currently looks like.
There are a couple of downsides to this approach. 

1. We have to remember the proper order of the arguments or we'll get values assigned to the wrong attributes. 

2. We can't tell from the calling code (where we have `.new`) what the attributes are, which means we're probably going to have to look at that initialize method to see what's going on there.

## Refactoring initialize

Using keyword arguments instead will solve both of these problems:

```rb
class Dog
  attr_accessor :name, :age, :breed, :image_url
  def initialize(name:, age:, breed:, image_url:)
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @breed = breed
    @image_url = image_url
  end
end
```

This will allow us to create a new dog like so:

```rb
@lennon = Dog.new(
  name: "Lennon Snow",
  age: "2 years",
  breed: "Pomeranian",
  image_url: "https://res.cloudinary.com/dnocv6uwb/image/upload/v1609370267/dakota-and-lennon-square-compressed_hoenfo.jpg"
)
```

<Note>

So, one thing we could do is to refactor initialize to use a syntax called keyword arguments. This will allow us to create a new dog by passing in a sequence of key-value pairs to our .new method call.

## Testing it out

## More Flexibility with Metaprogramming

```rb
class Dog 
  attr_accessor :name, :age, :breed, :image_url, :favorite_treats
  def initialize(attributes = {})
    attributes.each do |attr, value|
      self.send("#{attr}=", value)
    end
  end
end
```

<Repl src="https://replit.com/@DakotaMartinez3/Metaprogramming-and-mass-assignment#main.rb" height="600px" />

<Note>

We can get additional flexibility when we do mass assignment with metaprogramming. 

Run repl.it right away to give it time to load.

Let's say we accept a hash of attributes as an argument for intialize and make it optional by setting its default argument to an empty hash. If we do this, then we'll be able to pass in as many or as few attributes as we like when we initialize a new Dog without causing an error.

Demo in the repl.it 

The send method here is how we solve the problem of accessing a property (or method in this case) that we don't know about ahead of time. So the analogy in JavaScript would be using bracket notation after an object and putting in an expression which will be evaluated first and then used as the key to unlock the appropriate value. So, the send method is the way we call a method on an object whose name is stored in a variable (or in this case partially stored in a variable because we need to add an equals sign here to make it a setter) 

Being able to write the code above from scratch is much less important at this point than understanding the implications of this approach. When you start using ActiveRecord later on in this phase, it'll sometimes be useful to keep in mind that something akin to this pattern is happening under the hood whenever you create a new instance of one of your ActiveRecord models. We'll be referring back to this pattern as we move forward, so we'll have a chance to review these ideas again later on. Know that a lot of the ruby magic is coming from metaprogramming (the code that creates other code-methods that create other methods)

## Introducing Class Methods

The main problem we're going to focus on today is how to keep track of multiple instances of the same class. 

<Step>

- Instance methods require an instance to be of any use
- What if we want to have a method in the class that we can call without needing an instance first?
- For those cases, we need a class method.

</Step>

<Note>

The main problem we're going to focus on today is how to keep track of multiple instances of the same class. Before we get into how, I want to discuss why class methods might be necessary

(Use arrows to expand)

- Instance methods require an instance to be of any use
- What if we want to have a method in the class that we can call without needing an instance first?
- For those cases, we need a class method.

## Example Class Methods


<Step>

- `.all` returns all of the instances we've created.
- `.create` - makes a new instance and persists it.
- `.find_by_name(name)` takes a name as an argument and returns the instance that has that name.
- `.by_breed(breed)` takes a breed as an argument and returns an array of all pets that share that breed.
- `.hungry` returns an array of all dogs that need feeding.
- `.needs_walking` returns an array of all dogs that need walking.

</Step>

<Note>

Let's take a look at some class methods we might want to have in our dog class

(Use arrows to expand)

- `.all` returns all of the instances we've created.
- `.create` - makes a new instance and persists it.
- `.find_by_name(name)` takes a name as an argument and returns the instance that has that name.
- `.by_breed(breed)` takes a breed as an argument and returns an array of all pets that share that breed.
- `.hungry` returns an array of all dogs that need walking.
- `.needs_feeding` returns an array of all dogs that need feeding.

Notice that one thing these methods all have in common, is that they don't necessarily relate to a particular dog instance that we already have access to. So, we'd want to be able to call these methods directly on the class without first having a Dog instance on hand (stored in a variable for example)

## 🔑 Class methods vs Instance methods & Self 🔑

#### Class methods are:
  - Defined **on** the class
  - Called **on** the class
  - and `self` refers to the class
#### Instance methods are:
  - Defined with**in** the class (but not *ON* it)
  - Called on an **in**stance of the class
  - and `self` refers to the **in**stance

<Note>

I've added the key emoji's here to indicate that this is a key concept to take away from today's lecture.

## Class/Instance methods & Self Demo

<!-- Begin Slide -->

```rb
class Dog
  puts "Inside the Dog class, self is: #{self}"

  @@all = []

  def self.all
    puts "Inside a class method in the Dog class, self is: #{self}"
    @@all
  end

  attr_accessor :name

  def initialize(name)
    self.name = name
  end

  def say_hi
    puts "Inside an instance method in the Dog class, self is: #{self}"
    puts "Hi there, I'm #{self.name}"
  end
end
```

<Repl src="https://replit.com/@DakotaMartinez3/Class-and-Instance-Methods-and-self#main.rb" height="500px"/>


<Note>

Here's a Demo class to illustrate the difference between class and instance methods both in the way that they are defined and the way that they are called.

You can run this demo using the command below and take a look at the class itself inside of the bin/class_and_instace_methods_demo file.

## Telling the Difference

We can tell that `.all` is a class method in 2 main ways from looking at code. 

1. The `.all` method is **defined** on `self` within the class (and `self` will be the class within the class)
2. The `.all` method is **called** on `Dog` in the pry, which also tells us that `.all` must be a class method.

Similarly, we can tell that `say_hi` is an instance method in 2 main ways from looking at the code:

1. The `say_hi` method is **defined within but not *ON*** the class.
2. The `say_hi` method is called upon an **instance** of the class (not the class itself)

<Note>

Look at main shared window here 

The goal is to be able to switch between this and the previous slide and use the mouse for emphasis as you make the connections between what's written at the bottom of this slide and the defining code on previous slide and the calling code on ths slide.

## How to Decide 

> When it comes to deciding whether a method should be a class method or an instance method, the main determining factor is how you plan to call the method. Will you call it directly **on the class**? If so-make it a **class** method. Will you call it **on an instance** of the class? If so-make it an **instance** method

## Breaking our Task into Manageable Chunks

- **Add ability to save dogs within the Dog class** 
  - Changes:
    - `@@all` will store them
    - `Dog.all` will retreive them
    - `Dog#save` will save them to `@@all`
    - `Dog.create` will initialize, save and return a new dog
  - Test this out by first using the console 
  - then refactoring our CLI code to use these new methods
  - then reworking the dogs_data.rb file so that it populates `Dog.all` instead of creating a global variable

## Breaking our Task into Manageable Chunks

- **Add ability to view all dogs who need a walk** 
  - Changes:
    - `Dog.needs_walking` will return all dogs that need a walk
  - Test this out by using the console to:
    - call `Dog.needs_walking`  
    - walking the last dog `Dog.all.last.walk`
    - check to see if the dog is still there with `Dog.needs_walking` (if not, you're good to go!)
  - then refactoring our CLI code to use this new method when the user picks option "5"

## Breaking our Task into Manageable Chunks

- **Add ability to view all dogs who are hungry** 
  - Changes:
    - `Dog.hungry` will return all dogs that need to be fed
  - Test this out by using the console to:
    - call `Dog.hungry`  
    - feed the last dog `Dog.all.last.feed`
    - check to see if the dog is still there with `Dog.hungry` (if not, you're good to go!)
  - then refactoring our CLI code to use this new method when the user picks option "6"

## Key Refactors for Dog Walker CLI

Dog class
  - refactor initialize method to use keyword arguments.
  - add a `.all` method and `@@all` class variable to keep track of all the dogs
  - add a `#save` method that will save an instance of the dog class to `@@all`
  - add a `.create(attributes)` method that take attributes as an argument and will instantiate and save a new instance of the dog class.
  - add a `.hungry` method that returns an array of all dogs that need feeding.
  - add a `.needs_walking` method that returns an array of all dogs that need walking.
  
In CLI
  - Add menu options for viewing all dogs that need feeding and all dogs that need walking.
  - rework the parts of the cli that were expecting to find all of our dogs in `$dogs` to use the `Dog.all` method instead.
    - we'll use `Dog.all` instead of `$dogs` to access the array of Dog instances
    - within the `add_dog` method, we'll create an instance of the `Dog` class using the `.create` method
  - within handle_choice, add logic for listing dogs who need walking or are hungry.

In dogs_data
  - Within the block that we pass to `.map` at the end of the file, invoke the `.create` method so that we use the data in all of the hashes to save the instances to `@@all` within the `Dog` class.
